Continue to learn Unity  
-- this game has similar mechanics to previous 2048 game
-- this game is a leveled game, opposite to scoring system in 2048  
-- on each level the player need to place a flower on designated position (sounds easier than it is)  
-- you have limited time and moves  
-- less moves - better score
